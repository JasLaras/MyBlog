              Why are all our AI voices female? Siri, Alexa, ...
              And all the intelligent and fictional AI voices male? Jarvis (Iron Man 2), Sully (I, Robot), ...

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently an undergraduate student studying Cognitive and Computer Science. 
    I work as an IT Assistant for the bus system on my college campus. 
    And in my free time, I play Stardew Valley, study Italian and Turkish, and collect sonny angels!
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to be a Renaissance Woman! I've always been fascinated with Da Vinci, and 
    I've always dreamed to grow into an individual who can honestly call themselves a polymath and a polyglot!
